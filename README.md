# About the project

I used a canvas tag and performed manipulations in Javascript to be able to draw on a whiteboard.

The logic to be able to draw consists of mouse events:
1- The one for clicking the mouse that activates the drawing mode;
2- when the mouse moves with the click activated continues drawing;
3- when you release the click it deactivates the drawing mode.

So I created the 3 events named as mousedown, mousemove, mouseup.
